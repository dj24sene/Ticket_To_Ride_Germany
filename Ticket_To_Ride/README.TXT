PROJECT TITLE: Ticket to Ride
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
VERSION or DATE: 4/30/2018
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Right click on the "TicketToRideDriver" class and 
then run the main method.
AUTHORS: Daniel Senecal, Zach Giannuzzi, Abdul Samad, Eric Sauer, 
Brianna Davis
USER INSTRUCTIONS: After running the main method, windows will pop up
prompting for you to enter names for two players, which type of 
destination tickets the players would like to look at, and two screens each 
displaying destination tickets for the players to claim. We
have limited our game to having just two players. 

For all of the pop-ups during the game, please do not click on the red x at
the upper right of the pop-ups. Instead follow the directions
or answer the questions asked in the pop-up. If you are completing an 
invalid move, do not worry because the program will not complete the 
invalid move.

Players must claim the destination tickets by clicking on the tickets. The 
tickets closer to the bottom of the window are the claimed destination 
tickets and the other destination tickets will be added back into the 
destination ticket deck. To confirm that you want to claim the tickets that 
you selected, you must click on the "Done" blue button located below the 
cards. To view the destination tickets that each player currently has, the 
player can click on the rectangular small brown map icon located in their 
"player space". Player 1's brown button is located in the upper right corner
of the window and Player 2's brown button is located in the lower right hand 
side of the window. The window will only display up to 18 destination cards 
at a time so it is recommended that each player limit the number of 
destination cards they claim to 18 each. To close the window, press the 
blue "Done" button. The number located near the rectangular small blue train 
icon indicates how many train cards the corresponding player has so far.

To draw train cards, click on any of the 5 train cards located in the 
middle-right of the JPanel or click on the draw train cards deck to the 
bottom left of the 5 cards (it has a blue backing). To draw more destination 
cards, click on the brown cards pile to the right of the train cards pile. 
Between the two piles is the GlobeTrotter card that you can click on to view 
its corresponding rules. To make the GlobeTrotter rules go away, click on 
the GlobeTrotter card again. To claim route, click on the two cities who lie 
at the ends of the route you would like to claim.

The number of trains each player has left is located under the white train 
icon corresponding to each player. After the game is done a summary of the 
scores will be shown.
